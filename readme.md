# BigQuery ML Model Registry 

## Description

The `bigquery-ml-model-registry` project leverages Google's BigQuery API in Python to create a robust and versatile machine learning model registry. Our model registry aims to make model management straightforward and systematic by including comprehensive information for each registered model.

## Features

- **Model Name**: Unique identifiers for each model
- **Model Type**: Classification, Regression, Clustering etc.
- **Features**: The features used in the model
- **Feature Importance**: Quantitative measures of the importance of each feature, where applicable
- **Performance Metrics**: Metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and RMSE to quantify the model's performance
- **Detailed Hyperparameter Specification**: Full specification of hyperparameters used in training the model
